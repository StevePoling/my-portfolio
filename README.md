# Steve Poling's Portfolio

Running a tutorial of AWS with ReactJS

## Technologies Employed

- brew,
- git, github,
- ssh
- HTML and CSS
- fonts from Google and Font Awesome

This project works very closely with AWS and the upload_portfolio-lambda.py runs as a Lambda function in AWS. You can install the boto library in Windows and OSX, but it really yearns for running in the AWS Cloud9 development environment.
